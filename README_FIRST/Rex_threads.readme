The   project responsible for developing    the Rex thread package has
ended. The  software  is no longer  available from gummo.doc.ic.ac.uk,
but may be available from some other source.

The only thing  you need to  change is the  signature of creatp to the
following:

struct pcb *creatp (int,  void (*func)(int, char**, void*), int,  int,
char **, void *);
