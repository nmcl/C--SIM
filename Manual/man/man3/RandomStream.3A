.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B RandomStream
class is the base class from which all other random number classes are
derived. It is not possible to create instances of this class,
rather other classs should be inherited from it to make use of
its functionality.

.B RandomStream
returns  a uniform  distribution based  upon  parameters
given, and the most  derived class  manipulates this  accordingly. The
algorithm uses a linear congruential generator and the results of this
are then shuffled with a multiplicative generator.

The
.B constructor
initializes the multiplicative and linear congruential generators with
the seeds provided, respectively.

The
.B operator () 
must be defined in one of the derived classes and is used to return the
random numbers for that class.

.B Error 
returns a chi-square error measure on the uniform distribution function.

.B Uniform 
returns the random number drawn from the uniform distribution.
