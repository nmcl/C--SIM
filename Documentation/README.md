In this directory you'll find an original technical paper on C++SIM which
was also published in the [C User's Journal Vol. 12, Number 3, March 1994](http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/rpn/biblio/ddj/Website/articles/CUJ/1994/9403/tocmar.htm). There's also
the user manual and Unix man pages. The man pages are not installed by default because we (used to) support more than the Unix operating system. However, if you want to install them then place them in section 3 of your distribution. You should consider using these manual pages in conjunction with the User Manual, which often has more details on specific aspects.


Note, the images directory is bitmaps that are used by the user manual, so don't move them in isolation.
