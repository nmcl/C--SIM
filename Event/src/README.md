This set of  classes  provides additional  functionality  not normally
provided  by  a  simulation package  modelled after  SimScript.  Where
possible these  routines still work with the simulation scheduler, but
since Suspend and Resume can be called directly when objects have been
removed  from  the  simulation  queue,  it  is  possible  to  reach  a
"deadlock" situation, where objects off the  queue  are suspended  and
cannot be resumed. Use with care.
