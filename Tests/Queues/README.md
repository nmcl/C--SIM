This tests the various scheduler queue implementations available.  The
graph  shows the   results   (time in milliseconds  versus  number  of
elements  in  the queue added  and  then removed).  These figures were
obtained by running the test on a lightly loaded iMac with 3.5 GHz i7
and 32 Gig of memory.

The first graph (results1.pdf) shows all of the list implementations.
The second graph (results2.pdf) removes ProcessList to give a clearer view
of how the other implementations perform.

Use the run script to generate the data.
