RZStacks implements pools of memory blocks which are bounded
by read and write-protected pages of memory, so that writes outside
the blocks are likely to cause segmentation violations. The memory blocks
are always multiples of the machine page size and are page aligned.

The main purpose of the class is to provide red-zoned stacks for
threads packages.
