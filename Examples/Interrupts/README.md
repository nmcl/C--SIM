This is a basic example of the new interrupt mechanisms added
in version 1.5.

A Processor object has two message queue, one for general messages and
one for interrupts (signals). The processor will wait for a set period
of time and will then inspect its general message queue for work to be
done.  This will be performed and then  it will go back to waiting.  A
Signal  object  will periodically wake  up and  send a  signal to  the
processor and place a message in to its signal queue.
