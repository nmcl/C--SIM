This director contains an example of a simulation written using the simulation
package. The example is taken from the book by Isi Mitrani (Simulation
Techniques for Discrete Event Systems p22).

The simulation is of a service which attempts to execute as many requests for
jobs as possible. The job requests are queued until the service can deal with
them. However, the service is prone to failures, and so jobs started will be
delayed until the service has been reactivated.

The classes provided include:

	Arrivals - This class controls the rate at which Jobs arrive at
		   the service (Machine)

	Breaks - This class controls the availability of the Machine by
		 "killing" it and restarting it at intervals drawn from
		 a Uniform distribution.

	Job - This class represents the jobs which the Machine must process.

	Machine - This is the Machine on which the service resides. It obtains
		  jobs from the job queue for the service and then attempts to
		  execute them. The machine can fail and so the response time for
		  jobs is not guaranteed to be the same.

	MachineShop - This is the main part of the simulation which starts the
		      various processes (Scheduler, Arrivals, Machine, Job)
		      involved. It also prints out statistics for the response time
		      for the jobs.

	Queue - This represents the queue which Jobs are placed on prior to being
		used by the Machine (service).

	Main - This is the body of the program which initializes the threads package
	       prior to the simulation starting.
